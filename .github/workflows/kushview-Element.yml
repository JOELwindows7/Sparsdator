# Maintainer: Admiral Zumi, Lebuz Slappafali, JOELwindows7
# Reason: The Binary file is paywalled & is subscription. 
# Descriptions: see https://kushview.net/element/download/ then `Prebuilt Intaller`.
# You can see in https://kushview.net/element/download/form/ , the buy only grants you 1 version 
# & download link only lasts 14 days after buy. to always have latest version, you must subscribe to some sort of
# Patreon. This is indeed adobe level of soul sucking.
# Instruction sauce from https://github.com/kushview/Element/blob/master/docs/building.md
